📚 Book Review Analysis (SQL & Power BI)

Leveraging Data to Optimize Bookstore Inventory & Marketing
🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes the [Book-Crossing dataset]([https://example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset), a large collection of book ratings and user demographics, to uncover reading trends and business opportunities for bookstores.

Using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, the project explores:
✔️ Top-rated books by category, country, and reader demographics
✔️ "Hidden gems"—books with high ratings but low visibility
✔️ Regional reading preferences to optimize inventory
✔️ Publisher insights based on popularity

🎯 Business Goal: Help bookstores make data-driven decisions to improve inventory, marketing, and customer engagement.
📊 Key Insights
1️⃣ Most Popular Books (Weighted Ratings)

Using a Bayesian weighted rating formula (similar to IMDb’s approach), we ranked books fairly to prevent bias toward books with only a few high ratings.

📌 Example (Top Books by Weighted Score):
Rank	Book Title	Author	Ratings	Avg Score	Weighted Score
1	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Postcard Book	J.K. Rowling	23	9.87	9.68
2	Postmarked Yesteryear: 30 Rare Holiday Postcards	P. Apkarian-Russell	11	10.00	9.62

2️⃣ Reading Preferences by Region and Age

📌 Readers in the USA & UK prefer bestsellers, while Europe leans towards literary fiction.
📌 Age-based preferences:

    18-30 years → Comics & Graphic Novels
    31-50 years → Art & Fiction
    51+ years → Classics & Literary Fiction

3️⃣ Hidden Gems – Underrated Books Worth Promoting

Books with high ratings but low visibility were identified, showing an opportunity for bookstores to promote niche bestsellers.

📌 Example: A Voice in the Wind (Mark of the Lion #1) – 10.00 avg rating but only 5 ratings.
